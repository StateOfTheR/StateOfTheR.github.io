      <description>R package {bigstatsr} provides a special class of matrix whose data is stored on the disk instead of the RAM, but you can still access the data almost as if it were in memory. It is particularly useful is you have a large matrix to analyze but not enough RAM on your computer. It can still be useful for matrices that fit in your RAM because package {bigstatsr} provides very efficient and parallelized algorithms (have you ever found cor or svd too slow?</description>
